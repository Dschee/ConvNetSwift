# ConvNetSwift
Swift port of [ConvnetJS](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/) - a library for training Deep Learning models (mainly Neural Networks).

Available NN Layer types:

- [x] Fully Connected 
- [x] Convolutional 
- [x] Dropout 
- [x] ReLU 
- [x] Sigmoid 
- [x] Maxout 
- [x] Hyperbolic Tangent
- [x] Local Response Normalization
- [x] Max Pooling
- [x] Output: Softmax, Regression, SVM

Optimization methods ('trainers'/'solvers'):

- [x] Stochastic Gradient Descent
- [x] Adam
- [x] Adaptive Gradient
- [x] WindowGrad
- [x] AdaDelta
- [x] Nesterovâ€™s Accelerated Gradient

Reinforcement learning:

- [x] Q-learning

Acceleration:

- [ ] Accelerate framework
- [ ] Metal


Work in progress.
